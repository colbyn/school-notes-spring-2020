\subsection{Explain how the study of biology could be used to improve and understand some aspect of the world.}
Biology is presumably the foundation of medicine and understanding ourselves.

\subsection{Develop a criteria to tell if a question or study is scientific.}
Science is falsifiable. 

\subsection{Diagram the steps of the scientific process.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Observation
    \item Question
    \item Hypothesis
    \item Experiment
    \item Analysis
    \item Conclusion
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Contrast the bias of humans in proving and disproving a claim.}
Humans are fallible and argumentative. Scientific models should be based on data, whereas humans may try to fit the data to the model, rather than fitting the model to the data. 

\subsection{Compare and contrast a hypothesis with a theory.}

A hypothesis precedes a theory; a theory is a hypothesis with substantial data underlying such.


\subsection{Design a controlled experiment with a hypothesis, null hypothesis, an independent variable and a dependent variable.}


\subsection{Explain a null hypothesis.}
\subsection{Explain some of the possible relationships between cause and correlation. }
\subsection{Explain the consequences of drawing conclusions and enacting policy using only corollary data.}
\subsection{Develop criteria for recognizing pseudoscientific claims.}
\subsection{Explain how scientists ensure that published research is scientific and credible.}
